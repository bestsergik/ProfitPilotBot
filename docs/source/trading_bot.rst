Trading Bot Documentation
=========================

Introduction
------------

This document outlines the structure and logic behind the cryptocurrency trading bot.
The main goal of this bot is to automate trading operations on the Binance exchange,
following a simple Moving Average Crossover strategy.

Setup
-----

Refer to README.md for setup instructions.

Code Structure
--------------

The code is structured in a modular way to ensure scalability and ease of debugging and testing.
The main components are:

- Data Retrieval: Functions to fetch historical and real-time data from Binance.
- Strategy Implementation: Functions to implement the trading strategy.
- Order Execution: Functions to place orders and manage trades.

Data Retrieval
--------------

The data retrieval part is handled by the following function:

- ``fetch_historical_data(symbol, timeframe)``:
    Fetches historical OHLCV (Open/High/Low/Close/Volume) data for a given symbol and timeframe.

Strategy Implementation
-----------------------

The core strategy is implemented by the following function:

- ``calculate_moving_averages(df)``:
    Calculates short-term and long-term moving averages on the closing prices of the historical data.

Further Work
------------

- Implement real-time data fetching to enable live trading.
- Implement order execution functions to place trades based on signals generated by the strategy.
- Implement risk management and performance evaluation modules to ensure the robustness of the bot.

.. note:: This code serves as an example and should not be used for real trading without further testing and analysis.
